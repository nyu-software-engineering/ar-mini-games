# AR Mini Games
_AR Mini Games_ (working title) is a project for mini games in Augmented Reality. Using the Unity engine in combination with ARCore and ARKit functionality we can bring these experiences to our users. Current game planned for production is AR Darts.

## Requirements
Minimum operating system requirements and UML diagrams are available [here](https://github.com/nyu-software-engineering/ar-mini-games/blob/master/REQUIREMENTS.md).

## Building and Testing The Project

## iOS Build 
Download the app directly to your iPhone from here: https://testflight.apple.com/join/QqSIY2N0

### Building onto iPhone from XCode Build W/O Using Unity  
1. Download iphone build for xcode here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/kj1ceviod5cnufi/DartsARBuild1.zip?dl=0
2. Unzip from the downloaded file: "DartsARBuild1". In the unzipped folder, open the following file in XCode: "Unity-iPhone.xcodeproj".
3. Connect iPhone to Mac
4. Afer opening, in XCode click the root folder: "Unity-iPhone". In the top left corner of XCode change "Generic  iOS Device" click and change the  device  to your connected iPhone

### Building and running in Unity Editor
